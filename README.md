# No Black Friday - Community Submissions

This repository lists companies, sites, SaaS, and apps that have decided to make **NO Black Friday deals** - because they offer fair prices all year round.

> "We don't do Black Friday. Don't buy from us if you need a discount. Just a fair price for everyone."

## How to Submit a Company

1. Edit the `urls.txt` file
2. Add the company URL on a new line (one URL per line)
3. Create a pull request with your submission
4. Once approved, the URL will be automatically processed and added to the landing page

### Example

```
https://example.com
https://another-company.com
```

## Guidelines

- Only submit legitimate companies/businesses
- Companies should have a clear "no Black Friday" policy or fair pricing model
- Ensure the URL is accessible and contains valid Open Graph metadata
- No spam or affiliate link abuse

## What Happens After Approval?

When your PR is approved:
1. A server-side script will parse the URL
2. It will automatically extract the Open Graph image, title, and description
3. The image will be saved to a local folder structure
4. The company will appear on the landing page
